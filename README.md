I chose to remove files through bash because I forgot to initially
add my gitignore. Apologies for the confusion, I made sure to *never* use
manually adding/deleting files through the git website. A lot of my design
is very bare-bones, and I plan to build on each feature in the next couple
of weeks. Thanks for grading!
